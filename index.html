                <h1>IMPORTANCE OF WEB AND APP</h1> Web app development empowers web-based projects to perform and
                act
                similarly to a mobile app. Web applications engage users, prioritizing responsive interactions, but
                are
                still delivered through the internet over a network.

                You can say that web app development is the posterity of web development. While web development and
                web
                app development share similarities, web app development is by definition more dynamic than
                traditional
                web development can offer.

                Both are important, but knowing the difference will help you understand what web app development is
                as
                well as whether or not it sounds like a good idea for your business.

                To find out more about web applications — from their advantages and disadvantages to the frameworks
                you
                should use to put them together — keep reading! A website is built on a platform that only the
                creator
                or developer can change. On the other hand, a web application is interactive and built on a platform
                that allows user data to inform iterations of the application. As they are a collection of HTML
                documents, web applications might be part of an established website or built as freestanding
                applications.

                The application must be delivered over a network and connected to a database. Where traditional
                websites
                serve the major purpose of delivering information (such as text or video) to the user, a web
                application
                allows its interactions with the user’s request to produce a variety of possible outcomes. Now for
                the
                fun step of having people try out your potential app. Alpha testing is done by designers, while beta
                testing is completed by users of the web app. Alpha testing entails addressing major problems or
                issues
                within the app by experts. Beta testing is more like having the app polished by public users. In
                alpha
                testing, software professionals do everything within their power to trick the app into an error. In
                beta
                testing, you want the largest possible number of public users to utilize the app, tell you what
                they’re
                doing or attempting to do, and report any malfunctions encountered in the process.

                Gather friends, colleagues, neighbors, and anyone willing to give you feedback. Let them play around
                with the app and see where strengths and weaknesses lie. This is where you get to learn information
                about user experience firsthand. Taking the time to validate your web app saves you immeasurable
                time
                and money by locating problems or areas of improvement before the app’s formal launch.</p>
